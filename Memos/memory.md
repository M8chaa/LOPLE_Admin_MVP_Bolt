## Project Memory Log

- Decided MVP tech stack:
  - Backend: Node.js, Express, SQLite (via Sequelize ORM), JWT for auth.
  - Frontend: React (Vite), TypeScript, Material-UI (MUI) for quick admin UI.
- Core domain entities identified for MVP: User (admin), Driver, Callcard (with basic fields + status + driver assignment).
- Focus: Simple yet functional core logic (auth, callcard CRUD, driver list, assignment) per PRD.
- Notes: Use PRD reference for naming and flows; no map or advanced features in MVP.
- MVP core backend and frontend implemented with essential features: login, dashboard, callcards CRUD & driver assignment.
