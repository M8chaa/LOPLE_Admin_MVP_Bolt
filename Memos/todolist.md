### MVP Status: **READY FOR DEMO**

**MVP Ready for tomorrow's briefing.** 

### Core Requirements Met:
✅ Authentication system with admin login  
✅ Dashboard with real-time KPIs  
✅ Callcard management (list, assign drivers)  
✅ Driver management (list, status tracking)  
✅ Database with proper relationships  
✅ RESTful API endpoints  
✅ Frontend with Material-UI components  
✅ Korean localization for sample data  

### Manual Browser Testing Needed:
- Login with admin/admin123 credentials
